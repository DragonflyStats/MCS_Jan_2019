While correlation is insufficient to confirm agreement between two methods, a sufficiently low correlation 
coefficient would signal lack of agreement. A low correlation coefficent between methods would necessarily indicate that
there is an inability to get plausible measurements in one, or both, devices. 

In the case of replicate measurements, a similar consideration arises for the between-item covariance. A significant difference in between-item would indicate
