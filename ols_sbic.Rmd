ols_sbic Sawa’s bayesian information criterion
Description
Sawa’s bayesian information criterion for model selection.
Usage
ols_sbic(model, full_model)
Arguments
model An object of class lm.
full_model An object of class lm.
Details
Sawa (1978) developed a model selection criterion that was derived from a Bayesian modification of
the AIC criterion. Sawa’s Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) is a function of the number of observations
n, the SSE, the pure error variance fitting the full model, and the number of independent
variables including the intercept.
SBIC = n  ln(SSE=n) + 2(p + 2)q 􀀀 2(q2)
where q = n(2)=SSE, n is the sample size, p is the number of model parameters including
intercept SSE is the residual sum of squares.
Value
