Models With Multiple Random-effects Terms
The mixed models considered in the previous chapter had only one random-effects term, which was a simple, scalar random-effects term, and a single fixed-effects coefficient. Although such models can be useful, it is with the facility to use multiple random-effects terms and to use random-effects terms beyond a simple, scalar term that we can begin to realize the flexibility and versatility of mixed models.

In this chapter we consider models with multiple simple, scalar random-effects terms, showing examples where the grouping factors for these terms are in completely crossed or nested or partially crossed configurations. For ease of description we will refer to the random effects as being crossed or nested although, strictly speaking, the distinction between nested and non-nested refers to the grouping factors, not the random effects.
